# Backend Document Indexer ML Hispano

This Repository is a implementation slightly modified from this [GraphQL - MongoDB and Node js Tutorial](https://academind.com/learn/node-js/graphql-with-node-react-full-app/).

I actually use some others tutorials.

I hope this project will be used as page-documents of Machine Learning - Data Science - etc-- for Community MLHispano

If you wanna install this example in your local project please follow this simple steps.

> Install Dependencies
``npm install``

> Run Project in mode development
``npm run dev``

The only file that is no commited is ``.env`` file, where is all information about database. you can use this proyect from your own database from your local machine or [MongoDBAtlas](https://www.mongodb.com).

There is just a .env layout without connection data.

## Notes

Just stay sure that you have created the Mongo Database in your local machine or this repository does not work.
